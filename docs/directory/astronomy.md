Astronomy APIs, Data, Software, Radio Astronomy, Visualization, SDKs & Software Development Tools and more.

## Astronomy APIs

* [AstroBin API](http://www.astrobin.com/help/api/) - AstroBin is an image hosting website specifically targeted to astrophotographers. Its API offers a basic set of RESTful endpoints. Currently the API is read-only, and  allows you to get data about images, and perform basic searches.
* [astrometry.net](http://astrometry.net/) - "If you have astronomical imaging of the sky with celestial coordinates you do not know—or do not trust—then Astrometry.net is for you. Input an image and we'll give you back astrometric calibration meta-data, plus lists of known objects falling inside the field of view."
* [Open Astronomy Catalog API](https://astrocats.space/) - The Open Astronomy Catalog API (OACAPI) offers a lightweight, simple way to access data available via the Open Astronomy Catalogs (e.g. the Open Supernova, Tidal Disruption, Kilonova, and Fast Stars Catalogs).
* [SpaceXDB-Api](https://github.com/R4yGM/SpaceXDB-Api) - [SpaceXDB](https://www.spacexdb.cf) is a website containing SpaceX launch information and telemetry.

## Astronomy Data

* [Canadian Astronomy Data Centre](http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/) - CADC is a Science Platform for data-intensive astronomy with many astronomy data products.
* [ESO Science Archive Facility](http://archive.eso.org/cms.html)
* [Gaia Data Releases](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/release)
* [NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
* [SIMBAD Astronomical Database](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/) - The purpose of Simbad is to provide information on astronomical objects of interest which have been studied in scientific articles.
* [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://www.sdss.org/) - Three-dimensional maps of the Universe

* [KStars](https://edu.kde.org/kstars/) - KStars is free, open source, cross-platform astronomy software. It provides many features, including a graphical simulation of the night sky, observing planner, a sky calendar tool, an FOV editor, and more.
* [LeoLabs Visualization](https://platform.leolabs.space/visualization) - Low Earth Orbit Catalog Visualization.
* [Mars Now](https://mars.nasa.gov/explore/mars-now/) - This visualization shows the current location and communication activity of all operating landers, rovers and orbiters at Mars that transmit data to Earth via NASA’s Mars Relay Network.
* [NASA Eyes](https://eyes.nasa.gov/) - Immersible apps to explore the Earth and solar system
* [Orb Viewer](https://parsecsreach.com/orbviewer) - Visualization of all the asteroids in the MPC database.
* [Orbit Simulator](http://www.orbitsimulator.com/gravity/articles/what.html) - A powerful numerical integration tool. "By performing n-body simulations, you can study the orbits of planets, moons, asteroids, or any object in the universe."
* [Orbiter 2016](http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/) - Open source spaceflight simulator with many addons for historical missions. [Installation Instructions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Orbiter/comments/mx2mjz/guide_for_beginners_to_orbiter/)
